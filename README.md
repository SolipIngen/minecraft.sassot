Welcome to Spears, Axes, Swords, Shields, and Other Tools, a mod that reworks many aspects to do with melee combat in Minecraft. Please report any technical issues you find here, while I ask you to make content-related feedback on the mod's CurseForge/Modrinth page.

This mod is licenced under the MIT License, so feel free to adjust the code according to your own personal tastes. However, I ask all references to the original mod be made back to the mod's CurseForge/Modrinth page, and please refrain from re-uploads with modifications. I also ask you to not distribute your personal adjustments of the mod without due credit to the original author.

Steadfast stance, for life is a dance.
